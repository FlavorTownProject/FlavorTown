<p>Finding new food has always been an ordeal, especially when at a new restaurant facing a new menu loaded with options. Hard earned money is at stake and ordering the wrong item can ruin oneâ€™s day. Today there exists applications that will lists what restaurants are good, but none go as far as to tell items on that restaurant's menu that makes that restaurant great. This need gives FlavorTown the opportunity to truly give the user a good idea of what food to order.</p>

<p>This will be a crowd sourced application with user rating as the backbone of the app. The user will be able to open up the app and locate restaurants in the area, either through the interactive map or through a list of nearby restaurants. Once having reached the locale, and having tried an item, the user is then able to rate the food. This rating will be aggregated and computed on the back end. Theses calculation will allow future eaters to be better informed about the food that they will choose to eat.</p>
